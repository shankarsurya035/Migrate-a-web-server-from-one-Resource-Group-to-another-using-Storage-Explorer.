Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer (Preview) is a standalone tool that helps you easily manage your Azure storage accounts. It's useful in situations where you want to quickly manage storage outside of the Azure portal, such as when you're developing apps in Visual Studio.
<br>This preview release enables you to easily work with blob storage. You can create and delete containers, upload, download, and delete blobs, and search across all your containers and blobs. Advanced features enable developers and ops to work with SAS keys and policies.<br>
Windows developers can also use the Azure storage emulator to test their code using the Local Development storage account.<br>
You can use Azure Storage Explorer to connect and manage your Azure storage service accounts and resources across subscriptions. In Azure Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, and Data Lake Storage, you can create, delete, view, and update resources.
